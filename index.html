          <p class="history-text"><i>Tout Puissant Mazembe, commonly referred to as TP Mazembe, is a Congolese professional football club based in Lubumbashi, the country's economic capital.
          The club was originally created in 1939 and rose to continental relivance in the 1960s post-indepence years. 
          In 1966, they realized the treble (national Championship, Coupe du Congo and Katanga Cup).
          In 1967 and 1968, it won the African Cup of Champions and the team would be finalist four times successively in (1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970).
          Mazembe was also the first team to successfully defend the African Champions Cup.
          After 18 years of absence from the continental scene, Mazembe returned to the African scene thanks to implication of the former governor of the Katanga province, Moïse Katumbi Chapwe.</i></p>

          <p>And after numerous attempts under his leadership, Mazembe would return to continental glory by winning the CAF Champions League in Novermber 2009 to be crowned the best team in Africa, but at the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup the team failed to accomplish much finishing 6th of the 7 teams compteting from all global football federations.</p>

      <div class="tribute-info">
          <p>However in 2010, Mazembbe would once again successfully defend their African title and would manage to improve their FIFA Club World Cup record by defeating both Pachuca of Mexico 1–0 in the quarter-finals and Internacional of Brazil 2–0 in the semi-finals.
          This accomplishement made Mazembe the first African team to ever play in the FIFA Club World Cup final where they would lose to Inter Milan 3-0.
          The same year TP Mazembe began construction on a 18, 000 person stadium that was set to international FIFA standards and includes a VIP press room, parking for vehicles and synthetic grass, all elite aneminites for African football and would cost the team $35 million USD.
          Around the same time club president Moise Katumbi also built the Katumbi Football Academy for youth players on 6 hectares of land, fit with 3 football fields, a swimming pool, 28 dorm rooms, 2 apartments for coaches, a cafeteria and most importantly a school that teaches the kids english and french and allows the 50% of players who don't succeed profesionaly to also receive a proper education.
          All of these investments surely paid off with Mazembe then going on to win their fifth 1st tier contiental title after winning the 2015 CAF Champions League, but they would also follow up by winning 2 2nd tier contiental cups taking home the CAF Confederation Cup in 2016 and 2017.
          Today Mazembe's academy has produced star players like striker Jackson Muleka who plays for Standard Liege in Belgium, and plans are underway for TP Mazembe to build a new 50, 000 person stadium by 2025 in order to increase the profitability of African football through improved infrastructures.</p>
